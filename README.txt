First, make sure you have a version of python installed.

Then, open 'entertainment_center.py' in IDLE and run the program.

For any subsequent runs, merely open the 'fresh_tomatoes.html' file that has 
been generated.

Note: if any changes have been made to the files 'entertainment_center.py', 
      'fresh_tomatoes.py', or 'media.py' please follow the second step in 
      opening the program for the new changes to be implemented.
